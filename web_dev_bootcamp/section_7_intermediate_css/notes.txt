- - #element -> [attribute] -> .class -> element
- - !important overrides all

- - you can also group selectors
- - can use > to select the child of a div

- - static positioning
- - - HTML default positioning
- - relative positioning
- - - moves relative from where it was
- - absolute positioning
- - - positioned relative to nearest positioned ancestor (or top left corner of webpage)
