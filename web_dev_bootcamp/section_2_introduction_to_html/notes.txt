# Notes

- HTML tags
- - Heading tags
- - - opening and closing tags
- - - content in between tags
- - - closing tag has "/" before the tag name
- - - tags + content is the element
- - - Do's and Don'ts
- - - - Don't double up on h1 tags
- - - - - Go to a h2 tag
- - - - Don't skip a tag level e.g. h1 -> h3
- - - - - Go down the numeric order

- - Paragraph tags
- - - Good for long form text, mostly unstyled

- - Self closing tags
- - - tags without content in between
- - - - <hr /> creates a line if put between two <p> tags
- - - - <br /> throws a new line, can use in the middle of <p> tags
- - - Do's and Don'ts
- - - - Don't add a break just to seperate two paragraphs
- - - - Do add a new paragraph tag to seperate the two
- - - Sometimes might see horizontal rule element without the "/", both are fine
