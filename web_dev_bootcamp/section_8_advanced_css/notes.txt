- - block vs inline display
- - - block takes up entire "line" (full width)
- - - inline can have elements side by side
- - can't set width/height to inline elements
- - with inline-block you can
- - - it's an inline display with block attributes
- - display: none; makes the element disappear

- CSS Float
- - allows text to wrap around images
- - think newspaper style layouts
- - clear attribute makes float not apply to element
