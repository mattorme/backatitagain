# Notes

- Lists
- - <ul> for dot points
- - <ol> for numbered points
- - both included list items <li> within them
- - you can also nest lists for <ul> (dot points)
- - indententation is super important for readability

- link tags
- - look like this <a>
- - include "attributes"
- - - "href" attribute links to url

- images
- - <img /> tag is self closing
- - "src" attribute links to where the image is coming from
- - - can be a url, but more than likely links to images in project folder
- - "alt" attribute includes description of text
- - - super important for accessibility

- file paths
- - ../ to go back
- - ./ to stay in current directory
- - / also works but not all the time
